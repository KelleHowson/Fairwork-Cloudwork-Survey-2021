# Fairwork-Cloudwork-Survey-2021
The Fairwork Project coordinated from the Oxford Internet Institute and the WZB Berlin Social Science Centre researches working conditions on digital labour platforms and rates them based on five co-developed principles of fair platform work. In 2021 the Project undertook a global survey of 699 workers on 14 platforms in 74 countries to support our rating of online remote digital labour platforms. This repository contains the survey and recruitment materials used.
